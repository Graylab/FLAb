# File Descriptions

`Rosace2023_Adalimumab_Tm` - Thermostability of clinically approved antibody adalimumab bound to TNF-α, where adalimumab had no self-association or cross-reactivity flags.

`Rosace2023_CR3022_Tm` - Thermostability of antibody obtained from SARS CoV-1 patient, also capable of neutralizing SARS CoV-2 and some of its variants of concern.

`Rosace2023_Golimumab_Tm` - Thermostability of clinically approved antibody Golimumab bound to TNF-α, where Golumumab had several self-association and cross-reactivity flags.

`Hie2022_C143_Tm` - Thermostability of unmatured, patient-derived antibody that binds the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike but was isolated before extensive in vivo somatic hypermutation.

`Hie2022_mAb114_Tm` - Thermostability of matured, patient-derived antibody that neutralizes ebolavirus by binding to its glycoprotein.

`Hie2022_MEDI8852_Tm` - Thermostability of highly matured, broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) that binds influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) across variants of both major phylogenetic groups (group 1 and group 2) and that reached phase 2 clinical trials.

`Hie2022_MEDI8852UCA_Tm` - Thermostability of unmatured, inferred germline sequence of MEDI8852, which only neutralizes viruses with group 1 HAs.

`Hie2022_REGN10987_Tm` - Thermostability of matured, patient-derived antibody that binds early variants of SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

`Hie2022_S309_Tm` - Thermostability of matured, patient-derived antibody that cross-neutralizes the sarbecoviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by binding to the spike glycoprotein (Spike).
